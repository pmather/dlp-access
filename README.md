# VTDLP Access Website
A Multi-Tenant Serverless Website built with GraphQL, React, AWS Amplify, AWS AppSync, DynamoDB, Amazon Cognito and OpenSearch. This project is part of the [Virginia Tech Digital Library Platform](https://about.digital.lib.vt.edu/project/) (VTDLP). We used this software to host several Virginia Tech University Libraries digital collections, see showcase below.

We also have a [Live Demo](https://vtdlp-demo.cloud.lib.vt.edu/) site.

## Software Stack 
* AppSync: We use AppSync to handle the communication with backend DynamoDB and OpenSearch. Please see the initial [examples](docs/appsync.md). This [file](src/graphql/queries.js) elaborates all the operations currently in use.
* [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/): We use Amplify to handle the authentication and authorization and connect to the backend AWS services. 
* DynamoDB: We use DynamoDB tables to store all the metadata.
* AWS OpenSearch: We use OpenSearch to enable full-text and faceted search.
* AWS Cognito: We use AWS Cognito to handle the authentication, authorization, and group permission.
* IIIF Images: We use [aws-batch-iiif-generator](https://github.com/vt-digital-libraries-platform/aws-batch-iiif-generator) to generate IIIF tiles and manifest in AWS.

## Launching the app
[![amplifybutton](https://oneclick.amplifyapp.com/button.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home#/deploy?repo=https://github.com/VTUL/dlp-access)

### Deploy the app using AWS CLI
* Create a branch with a backend environment
```
aws amplify create-branch --app-id=AmplifyAppId --branch-name=GitHubBranchName --backend-environment-arn=BackendEnvARN
```
* Deploy the app
```
aws amplify start-job --app-id=AmplifyAppId --branch-name=GitHubBranchName --job-type=RELEASE
```
* Get Backend Environment Arn
```
aws amplify list-backend-environments --app-id=AmplifyAppId
```

### Run locally with the Amplify CLI
0. Prerequisites
  ```sh
  npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
  brew install yarn
  ```

1. Clone the repo

  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:VTUL/dlp-access.git
  ```

2. Change into the directory & install dependencies

  ```sh
  cd dlp-access
  npm install
  ```

3. Initialize the Amplify backend

  ```sh
  amplify init
  ```

4. Push the application into your account

  ```sh
  amplify push
  ```

* Default group: `public`

## Amplify Environment variables
We assign each site with a unique ```REACT_APP_REP_TYPE```.

As an example, the site of [IAWA](https://iawa.lib.vt.edu/) takes these settings below:
```
REACT_APP_REP_TYPE=IAWA
```

The site of [Demo](https://vtdlp-demo.cloud.lib.vt.edu/) takes these settings below:
```
REACT_APP_REP_TYPE=Default
```

### More Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| REACT_APP_MINT_LINK | [Mint service](https://github.com/vt-digital-libraries-platform/mint) API URL |
| REACT_APP_MINT_API_KEY | Mint service API key |
| USER_DISABLE_TESTS | Enable/disable Amplify tests |

If deploying an instance of the Podcast Repository he site must be able to authenticate itself with the NOID minting servicein order to support creating Podcast episode records through the site admin interface. So two additional environment variables are required. The values to be assigned to these variables can be found in the AWS API Gateway console.

```
REACT_APP_REP_TYPE=podcasts
REACT_APP_MINT_LINK=https://<api id here>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/mint
REACT_APP_MINT_API_KEY=<your api key here>
```

## Amplify Build settings
* Use [amplify.yml](examples/amplify.yml) for version after v1.3.2



## Site custom images and HTML files
We put custom static images (e.g., site cover image) and HTML files (e.g, about page) in a S3 bucket with Cloudfront setup.

See instruction and various site content examples below:
* [Instruction](https://github.com/VTUL/dlp-access/wiki/Customization)
* [html](examples/html/) exampes
* [images](examples/images/) exampes
* [Demo site](https://vtdlp-demo.cloud.lib.vt.edu/) configuration: [examples/default.json](examples/default.json).

## Running the tests
* An end-to-end testing framework using [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) has been setup for this project.
<img src="https://img.cloud.lib.vt.edu/images/e2e.png" width="80%"/>

* To test locally

  0. Put your configuration json files to a S3 bucket and enable CORS and make the config file public. 
  1. Start local server using ```REACT_APP_REP_TYPE=Default npm start```
  2. Launch the Cypress app ```CYPRESS_password=<secret> CYPRESS_userPoolId=<your user pool Id> CYPRESS_clientId=<your user pool client Id> yarn run cypress open``` Note: Environment varibles in the above command beginning with `CYPRESS_` must be updated with your actual account values

  * The username for authentication is: `devtest`. You can create this `devtest` account through account creation page.
  * You can create your own testing account and password, and update the username. E.g., [an example here](https://github.com/VTUL/dlp-access/blob/dev/cypress/integration/admin_page_sitepages_config.spec.js#L1)


## Cleanup
If you'd like to tear down the project & delete all of the resources created by this project, you can run the following:
```sh
amplify delete
```
